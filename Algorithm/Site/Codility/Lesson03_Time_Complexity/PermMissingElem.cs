     A zero-indexed array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

     Your goal is to find that missing element.

     Write a function:

     class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
     that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the missing element.

     For example, given array A such that:

     A[0] = 2
     A[1] = 3
     A[2] = 1
     A[3] = 5
     the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

     Assume that:

     N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
     the elements of A are all distinct;
     each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
     Complexity:

     expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
     expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
